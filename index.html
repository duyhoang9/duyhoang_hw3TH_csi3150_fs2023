          "This was a fantastic experience, we saw so much, the wildlife, the
          scenery and met interesting people and really got to know Alaska. It
          really was the best way to see Alaska! We loved getting out onto the
          glacier with crampons. My daughter loved the ice climbing. Sea
          kayaking was great. Thank you for a memorable, unique trip!"
